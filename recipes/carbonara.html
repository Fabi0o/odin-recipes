    <p>
      Pasta carbonara is an indulgent yet surprisingly simple recipe. Featuring
      bacon (or pancetta) with plenty of Parmesan, this recipe takes only 30
      minutes to prepare from start to finish!

    <p>
      Spaghetti alla carbonara. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta
      carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ingredients are simple—just spaghetti (or another long pasta), and the
      carbonara is made with pancetta or bacon, eggs, Parmesan, a little olive
      oil, salt and pepper.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subsection">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
      <li>1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
      <li>3-4 whole eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subsection">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every
        2 quarts of water.)
      </li>
      <li>
        While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a
        large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook
        slowly until crispy. Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute,
        then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook,
        uncovered, at a rolling boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs
        to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping
        wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta
        to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs
        sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so
        that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the
        tricky part.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more.
        Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it
        from drying out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black
        pepper. If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
