# odin-recipes

This is my odin-recipes project. While doing it i had to demonstrate my basic html skills
as working with texts, links and photos.
I also encoutered a problem while doing the lasagna recipe. In one of the steps there were a forword slash which html saw as a ending tag. So for the first time i had to google something to resolve a coding problem.
